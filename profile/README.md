## 🧊 Storage Tips

- Use BPA-free containers or freezer-safe bags  
- Store in fridge (up to 3 days) or freezer (up to 3 weeks)  
- Always thaw in the fridge, not the microwave

## 🔄 Transitioning Your Cat to Homemade Food

Don’t go cold turkey. Start by mixing small portions of homemade food with their current meals. Gradually increase the homemade portion over 7–10 days. Watch for signs of acceptance, allergies, or digestive issues.

Consult a vet before making a full switch, especially if your cat has health issues.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Always consult with a veterinarian before making dietary changes for your cat. Homemade food requires proper supplementation to ensure your pet receives complete nutrition.
